DTT License - Dont Touch This

This is a work in progress, its not meant to be finished code yet.

You can look, but you don't touch.
No you don't

MY my my my Code hits so hard
Makes me say, "Oh my Lord"
Thank your for reading me
With a mind to rhyme and two hype hands
It feels so good, when its compiles down
A super dope homeboy from Zig Town
And I'm known as such
And this heres a func, you don't touch

Dont Touch This
Dont Touch This
Dont Touch This

Less you know what ya do'in boy
Dont Touch This

Oh oh oh oh
My my my my
