DTT License - Dont Touch This

This is a work in progress, its not meant to be finished code yet.

You can look, but you don't touch.
No no no no
.. you don't

MY my my my Code hits its ho-ard
Makes me say, "Oh my Lo-ard"

Coding in this gilded seat
Making ryhmes with a keyboard beat

It feels so good, compile it down
A super dope homeboy from Zig Town

Read it, run it, copy a bunch
But this here func - you don't touch

Dont Touch This
Dont Touch This
Dont Touch This
Dont Touch This

Less you know what ya do'in boy
Dont Touch This

Oh oh oh oh
My my my my
