<div>
  <h1>Summary Stamement Page</h1>
  Details in this file, up to the 1st .section
  are included in the "printHeader()" function.

  .customer_details
  <h2>Customer</h2>
  <p>Name: {[name]s}</p>
  <p>Address: {[address]s}</p>
  <p>Credit Limit: $ {[credit]d:.2}</p>

  .invoice_table
  <h2>Invoices</h2>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Date</th>
      <th>Details</th>
      <th>Amount</th>
    </tr>

    .invoice_row
    <tr>
      <td>{[date]s}</td>
      <td>{[details]s}</td>
      <td>$ {[amount]d:.2}</td>
    </tr>

    .invoice_total
    <tr>
      <td></td>
      <td>Total Due:</td>
      <td>$ {[total]d:.2}</td>
    </tr>

  </table>

  Note that there is no need to add a footer section -
  everything after the last .section is printed when
  that .section is printed.
