.header
    This is the header which is perfectly valid

.body
    Here is some body content which has what may be taken as a 
    .phantom directive
    Which its not, its just normal content that 
    .happens to start with whitespace+dot

.footer
    and now the state recovers and its back to finding
    directives
    .cant-have-dashes-in-names
    .or[brackets]
    .or{curlyBrackets}
    .not_allowed:to_have_colons_either
    .nested_footer
        and nested directives with leading whitespace as well
